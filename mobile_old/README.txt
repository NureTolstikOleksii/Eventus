Precondition:
You have to pre-install node js on your computer.
You could find it with that link:
It's better to download prebuilt version
https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer
				    


1.Install dependencies

npm install

2.Start the app

npx expo start


3. Sometimes you maybe need to restart a TypeScript for project to work correctly, for that you could press key stroke combination: CTRL + SHIFT + P and > TypeScript  Restart TypeScript server


If that's not a solution in your situation and project is not going to run:

1. Try to install or reinstall react native

Insert that command in your shell -------- expo upgrade ---------

2. npm install react-native@0.64.3 (only in situation when nothing helps)

3. Or if we are going to use yard in future - yarn add react-native@0.64.3
